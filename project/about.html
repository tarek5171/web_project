        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>ROOTED IN THE HEART OF A TOWN WHERE SMOKE AND PASSION COMBINE.</p>
        <p>OUR DREAM WAS SIMPLE - TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER OVER A LOVE FOR REAL BBQ.</p>
        <p>OUR SPIRIT IS AS FIERCE AS THE FIRE WE COOK ON, DRIVEN BY THE PURE JOY OF SHARING A GOOD MEAL.</p>
        <p>AT THE CORE OF OUR HEARTH, BBQ ISN'T JUST A DISH - IT'S A CELEBRATION OF COMMUNITY AND CONNECTION.</p>
        <p>FOR US, IT'S ALL ABOUT THAT MOMENT WHEN FRIENDS AND FAMILIES GATHER AROUND, FORK IN HAND, READY TO DIVE IN.</p>
        <p>IN THIS SPACE, EVERYONE IS WELCOME, EVERY STORY IS HEARD, AND EVERY BITE IS A TASTE OF HOME.</p>
